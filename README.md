Potential furture and/or current employers and collaborators can explore my portfolio find out details about both my professional and personal life, and to view work that I have cmpleted, including projects that I have done for my Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. The navagation bar directs users to each of the appropriate sections: Profile, Portfolio, and Contact. Each item within the Portfolio section links to the deployed project that it refrences.
